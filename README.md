# ProgressSDG
ProgressSDG is a tool for viewing global progress on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The single-page application covers 17 milestones and hundreds of indicators across environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives. Using data sourced from the UN SDG API, ProgressSDG dynamically updates its main dashboard to display the goal the user wants to see. These are grouped into three sections: a summary of progress, related goal details and indicators, and  an assessment of data quality.
